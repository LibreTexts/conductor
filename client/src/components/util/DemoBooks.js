        summary: "This text is designed for the second-semester general chemistry course honors course and has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most general chemistry courses. The text materials covers three primary units: Thermodynamics, Physical Equilibria and Chemical Equilibria with seven Chapters. The organization was careful formulated to introduce enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy, and then use these skills to understand physical and chemical equilibria.",

        summary: 'This manual is the culmination of the efforts of many individuals. While some of the experiments are "classics", and appear in various forms in many Quantitative Analysis textbooks and laboratory manuals, much effort was expended to ensure that the experiments work well here at UC Davis and thus each experiment has been extensively tailored for our laboratory program. We view this manual as one of continual modification, and often improvements arise from comments and criticisms.',
